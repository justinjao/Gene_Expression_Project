# Gene Expression Project

This is a copy of an original gene expression analysis project I conducted at
the Ciernia lab (the original repository is currently housed in the Ciernia Lab
GitHub, and set to private). Since the data and the results I generated from
this analysis have yet to be published, for the sake of privacy I have
scrubbed anything of note (all original datasets and revealing experimental
information such as variable names, spreadsheets, key figures etc.).

Inside, you'll find a copy of the original README used to explain the analysis,
as well as the file directory structure I used for the project (the only reason
I left these empty directories in is to show how I organize projects),
and some key figures generated from the analysis, and the scripts used to
generate these figures (appropriately censored, of course).

 Under documentation, there is also a PowerPoint I previously made to explain to
 my fellow lab mates what the analysis was. Feel free to check this out if you
 want a bit more of a background explanation on what the figures are supposed
 to represent.

 **My goal in posting this is to showcase how I organize my projects, some of the
 visualizations I worked on, as well as how I annotate and document my
 analysis/code for others to more easily understand.**
